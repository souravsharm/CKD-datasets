# CKD-datasets
If you are looking for the CKD dataset, I have found and listed a few of them. Hope this helps :) 
I am not taking any credit for the dataset, the credit belongs solely to the creators. Most of the datasets here have open license. 


This one does not have any file attached, but can be requested from the author: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40620-023-01573-4
